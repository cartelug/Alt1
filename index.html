    <h2>About Me (Biography)</h2>
    <p>
      I am Neeza Shyaka, a 17 year-old Rwandese student currently living in
      Kampala, Uganda. Standing at 6'4" and weighing 165 pounds, I am also a
      dedicated division athlete, playing football here in Uganda, which
      requires discipline and teamwork. Skills I believe are valuable
      everywhere. Balancing sports and academics is important to me. I come from
      a supportive family with both my parents present in my life, alongside my
      biological brother and three non biological brothers who are just like
      family. My interest in technology, problem solving, and building things
      has led me to pursue software engineering at AltSchool.
    </p>

    <h2>Why I Joined AltSchool's School of Engineering</h2>
    <p>
      I joined the School of Engineering program specifically to get in-depth
      knowledge about coding and to become a skilled, practical software
      engineer. I believe AltSchool offers a direct path to gain the technical
      skills, hands-on experience, and industry understanding needed to succeed
      in the tech world.
    </p>
